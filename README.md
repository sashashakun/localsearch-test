## Test task for Localsearch.

I am using here Vercel in order to deploy app fast and do not spend time on infrastructure. Also I used Vite to build app w/o spending time on configuration. Additionally I choosed React because I have most expirience with it across web framework.

Links helped me to build:
- [Vercel docs](https://vercel.com/docs)
- [Vite docs](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
- [Deca UI docs](https://www.deca-ui.com/)
- [React-Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
